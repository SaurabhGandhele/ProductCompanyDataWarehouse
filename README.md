Created a data-mart for increasing the product sales and profit by designing a star schema dimensional model.
Implemented SCD (slowly changing dimensions) Type 1, 2, 6 (2+3+1) to maintain historical data, role playing dimensions for order and 
shipping dates, lost and shrunken dimensions for aggregation and semi-additive fact table for invoices.
